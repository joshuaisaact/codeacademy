Wine Festival Schedule

In this project, we’re going to practice tabular organization in HTML so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? If you’re going to have data on a webpage, you’ve got to master the skill of effectively and aesthetically organizing it – an HTML table is the perfect solution.

The Aguillar Family is hosting their annual wine festival and they have asked you to build a web page for the event schedule! Use your knowledge of HTML to display a table to the attendees.
