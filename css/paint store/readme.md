Paint Store

In this project, we’re going to practice design in CSS so you can hone your skills and feel confident taking them to the real world. Why? You’ll feel comfortable with the various forms of color representation in CSS.

In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.

The page is almost ready to be published. You’ll be making the following color-related changes:

Exchange some named colors with hexadecimal color values.
Add some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.
Fill in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.
The website’s existing index.html and style.css document files are displayed in the text editor.
